*MyPolymorphism.txt*   Extended "%" polymorphism

Edit mode, hence type ':MyPolymorphism' and
check for outputs.
Check directory autoload/foo for extension covered..
Check with another extension that does not exist 
in autoload/foo. 
The aim is to test on extensions with polymorphism.

Tests can be made on opening files s.a:
>
   test.xml test.a test.cpp_
   test.cpp test.b test.cll
   test.c   test.c++
<

If extension does not exist errors occured
when extension are not covered within 
plugin MyPolySortOfWay.
