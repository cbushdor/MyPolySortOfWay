*MyPolySortOfWay.txt*   Extended "%" polymorphism

Add  ~/.vimrc the following line:
>
   source ~/.vim/plugged/MyPolySortOfWay/filterTranstypage/filter.vim
<

This is where you can add types.

Read the following:
>
   help MyPolySortOfWay.txt
   help Hello.txt
   help MyPolymorphism.txt
   help MyFormatXML.txt
<

If extension does not exist error occured whatever
the method used!
If not, then add your extension to ftplugin or
autoload...
If, it still does not work add this into file ~/.vimrc.
For instance we want a file type s.a '*.a' to be 
accepted hence, add the following line into your 
~/.vimrc file:
>
   au BufRead,BufNewFile *.a set filetype=a
<

Hopefully, it should work!

Good luck!
